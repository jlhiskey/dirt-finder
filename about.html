                <ul class="lists">
                  <li>Hometown: Jason was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado. When he was 2 years old he moved to Washington where he spent the majority of his childhood in Monroe. While living in Monroe, he learned how to crash dirt bikes and jump off of tall objects into the water. He currently lives in the quickly growing town of Bothell.</li>
                  <li>Former Career: Before embarking on his coding journey, Jason was a staff geologist who worked on hundreds of construction sites in Seattle and Los Angeles.</li>
                  <li>Favorite Hobby: Jason likes to spend his free time working in his vegetable garden and spending way too much money buying new games on Steam.</li>
                  <li>Favorite Food: Jason enjoys most foods that exist but especially enjoys quesadillas.</li>
                  <li>Future Goals: Jason plans on becoming a solid full stack Java Script Developer who will be able to save up enough money to one day finance and manage a food truck company called “The Quesadilla Factory”, which will cater toward fellow aficionados of quesadillas.</li>

                <li>Hometown: Reed was born in Chelan, Washington, where he lived for 8 years before moving to Spokane where he spent the rest of his childhood. </li>
                <li>Former Career: Before attending Code Fellows, Reed received a degree in Communications from The University of Redlands in sunny Southern California.</li>
                <li>Favorite Hobby: When Reed isn’t sitting behind a laptop writing code he likes to spend his spare time surfing but has found that the surfing conditions are much more favorable down in Southern California.</li>
                <li>Favorite Food: Reed really enjoys sitting down to a giant plate of delicious chicken and waffles, especially is it’s being served from his favorite restaurant “Screen Door” in Portland, Oregon.</li>
                <li>Future Goals: Reed would love to live somewhere that is close to a sweet surf spot near a tasty chicken and waffle restaurant.</li>
