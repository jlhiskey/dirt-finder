Jobsite Superintendent

	As a site superintendent I want to be able to post information about if I am importing/export material from my site for other jobsite superintendents to see so that they can contact me. This is important to me because without importing/exporting materials from my site I wont be able to continue work on the site. This would be a nice app because right now I have to try and call a bunch of different people and it would be great to be able to look at a map instead.

Company Superintendent

	As a company superintendent I want to be able to see an overview of all of the different sites that are importing/exporting materials in order to get an idea of the overall regional dirt situation to get a rough idea if the materials that I am looking for are available. I also want to be able to help out my jobsite superintendent and post import/export pins as well.

Trucking Company

	As a trucking company I want to be able to look at a map of the region and see if there is any potential work available for my company and where that work is located.
